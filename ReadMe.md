1. in game when we see a character moving it is actually not like video but pic updates. FPS 60, means a screen updates 60 times within a second then it will not look like a picture but a animation moving. So your character looks moving but its actually a series of 60 static images. 
    <br>so to do this animation in our game we need to create a time in our game we need to start this game clock. and to do that we will use a class called Thread and i will mane this gameThread. 
<br> Thread is something you can start and stop and once a thread started, it keeps your program running until you stop it.
